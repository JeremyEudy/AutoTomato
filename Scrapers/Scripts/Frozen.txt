               ANTARCTIC STATION AND SGC. SAM AND DR. MICHAELS ARE CONVERSING

                         "It's a blip, a shadow on the ultrasound...too 
                         deep to tell. You know, maybe a dead 
                         seal. Anyway, we're, uh, we're gonna 
                         rule it out and pack up for the season. 
                         Another week or two, it'll be dark most 
                         of the time, much too cold to work outside. 
                         As far as coming back next year, well, 
                         you know it's not up to me. The Pentagon 
                         reevaluates our presence here every 
                         year. Take it up with them."
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "Well, maybe my new conclusions about 
                         the DHD will be enough to convince them 
                         that we should continue."
 
               
                                     DR. MICHAELS

                         more weight."
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "The one found with the Antarctic 'gate 
                         died shortly after it was brought back 
                         to Area 51. It was used a few times 
                         and then just ran out of energy. That 
                         was the first indication we had that 
                         the power sources fueling the 'gate 
                         technology have a limited life span. 
                         We've run a number of tests comparing 
                         the power source to other off world 
                         DHDs. We think we now have evidence 
                         that the 'gate we found down there is 
                         one of the oldest in the entire system. 
                         It could be as much as 50 million years 
                         old."

                         "The Antarctic plate wasn't covered 
                         by glacier back then. It wasn't even 
                         at the South Pole."
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "Well, the 'gate didn't necessarily 
                         originate there. It could have been 
                         moved from another planet at any point 
                         in time, but that's what we need to 
                         try and determine.

                         grabs the paddles and heads toward "Aiyana".)

               Switch to viewer perspective again. Aiyana is looking around. 
               She does appear to be quite frightened. She still has EEG leads 
               on her head, EKG leads on her chest and the respirator tube down 
               her throat.

                         "It's okay. Hey, it's okay...it's okay...shhh." 
                         (as "Aiyana" becomes more agitated.) 
                         "Can we take the tube out?"

                         "Yeah." (Janet and Jonas switch places 
                         so that Janet is now closer to "Aiyana's" 
                         head.) "It's okay. Sam, give me a hand. 
                         Easy...easy...hang on." (Janet moves 
                         to stand at the top of the gurney and 
                         she removes the respirator tube.) "Take 
                         it easy....it's okay." (As "Aiyana" 
                         coughs several times.) "It's okay....there 
                         we go...yeah." (Suddenly, "Aiyana" begins 
                         convulsing. "Oh, ho, whoa...Michaels...2.5 
                         milligrams Valium." (Michaels moves 
                         to inject the dose into the IV line.) 
                         "Easy, nobody's gonna hurt you. It's 
                         okay. Here you go....here you go...yeah."
 
                         
               
               "Aiyana" becomes calmer as the Valium begins to take effect.

                         on the gurney, now dressed in medical

                         her sides. She looks a little drowsy,

                         in, both wearing surgical masks. "Aiyana" 
                         seems a bit frightened as they approach.

                         Osbourne is entering the base, carrying 
                         a case and stumbling. He falls as he 
                         makes it inside.

               Teal'c and Jack arrive seconds later, followed by Sam and Janet 
               who enter through a different door. Jack kneels down beside Osbourne.

               Jack and Teal'c leave on their search. Sam walks over and picks 
               up Osbourne's hat and the case he had been carrying (containing 
               the core samples). She and Jonas head back toward the labs.
 
               
               Jonas enters the isolation lab where Aiyana has been watching 
               some of the activity through a window.
 
               
                                     JONAS

                         and Teal'c went out there to find him. 
                         Hope they do. Dr. Michaels and Dr. Osbourne 
                         are both...sick. Dr. Fraiser thinks

                         Eventually, we're all gonna be very

               Aiyana approaches with a questioning look and pointing to herself 
               as if to say "something I've done?"

                         "Do you?" (Again Aiyana looks at him 
                         with an inquiring look.) "You can understand 
                         me?" (Aiyana nods yes.) "You're a quicker 
                         study than I am. So, is there anything 
                         at all that you can tell me about this 
                         disease you're carrying? Why you're 
                         not sick? You don't know? Y-You don't 
                         remember anything? Do you know how you're 
                         able to heal yourself?" (Aiyana nods 
                         no.)

                         and Osbourne are laying on cots. Sam

                         the body to heal."

                         "The problem is, Jonas, we don't know 
                         how much time we have."

                         Antarctic exterior...Teal'c and Jack 
                         are still out searching.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         "O'Neill!" (Teal'c has found Woods).
 
                         
               
                                     TIME JUMP
                         Teal'c and Jack are speeding back into 
                         the entrance of the base, with Woods 
                         on a stretcher in tow. Janet greets 
                         them and bends down to Woods and Jack 
                         and Teal'c dismount their snow mobiles.
 
                         
               
                                     JANET
                         "Let's get him into the lab. On three...one, 
                         two, three."

                         " He's in hypothermic shock. We need 
                         to get his clothes off." (Aiyana watches 
                         as Janet and the others begin working 
                         on Woods...removing clothing, etc.) 
                         "We need to get him wrapped in warm 
                         blankets. Sam, I need you to hook him 
                         up onto the monitor."
 
               
               Jonas pulls off a boot and then a sock to reveal severe frostbite 
               on Woods' feet and lower legs.
 
               
                                     JONAS
                         "This can't be good."

               
                                     SAM
                         "Oh, my God." She turns back to hooking 
                         on the EKG leads as Janet begins to 
                         "bag" him.
 
               
               Jonas removes the other boot and sock to reveal a similar looking 
               foot. The EKG monitor begins to flat line.
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "He's in V-fib." (to Sam) "You get the 
                         paddles, I'll get the jell." (Sam and 
                         Janet prepare the defibrillator). "Ok...everybody 
                         clear."
 
               
               As Janet gets ready to zap Woods, Aiyana steps up. She has been 
               slowly circling around the action and has approached Woods from 
               the opposite side from everyone else.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         "Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey!"

               
                                     JONAS
                         "No, no, no...wait...wait."

               
                                     JANET
                         "Jonas..."

               
                                     JONAS
                         "Let's see...let's see what she does."
 
                         
               
               Aiyana places her left hand on Woods forehead and her left hand 
               on his chest.
 
               
                                     JONAS
                         "Wait." (He walks around to stand beside 
                         Aiyana.)
 
               
               A look of discomfort comes over Aiyana's face as she begins to 
               "heal" Woods. Janet and Sam look on with apprehension. Seconds 
               later, Woods gasps. Sam looks down to Woods feet and sees them 
               quickly return to a healthy state. All look on in amazement as 
               Aiyana continues to heal Woods. When she is done, she collapses 
               backward into Jonas' arms.
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "His vital signs are back to normal."
 
                         
               
               Janet looks at Jonas, who nods his understanding. Jack, Sam and 
               Teal'c are each seen with looks of disbelief or amazement on 
               their faces as the scene fades out.

                         "You okay?" (Aiyana nods yes.) "Do you 
                         know what you did?" (Again she nods 
                         yes.) "Do you know how you did it?" 
                         (Aiyana nods no.) "Can you do it again?" 
                         (Aiyana frowns as though she is unsure.) 
                         "Dr. Michaels and Dr. Osbourne are both...they're 
                         in very bad shape. And if you can't 
                         help them..." (Aiyana nods yes.)

                         The barracks. Janet is sitting on the 
                         edge of the bed where Michaels is laying. 
                         Jonas and Aiyana enter the room and 
                         Aiyana approaches Michaels. She kneels 
                         down beside the cot and places her hands 
                         on Michaels just as she did to Woods. 
                         Time jump: Janet, Osbourne, Michaels 
                         and Jonas return to the research lab 
                         from the barracks. Sam, Jack, Teal'c 
                         and Woods are there.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "I guess it worked."

                         "So this is good, right? When she wakes 
                         up, she can zap us all?"

                         "Not necessarily...healing them really 
                         exhausted her."
 
               
               Janet walks away. Sam follows her. Janet sits down at a monitor 
               and Sam walks up behind her.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "What is it, Janet?"

                         "It's a blood sample from Aiyana. I'll 
                         know more in a little while."
 
               
               Sam sits down in a chair behind Janet. Janet turns around to 
               look at her.
 
               
                                     JANET

                         "Yeah. What do you think the problem 
                         is?"

                         do what she does, it weakens her...more 
                         each time. I mean, she's still carrying 
                         that virus herself, Sam. I'm afraid 
                         there's going to be a point where she 
                         puts herself at risk."

                         "Good luck."

               
                                     JANET
                         "Yeah."

               
               Time passes. Janet walks back into the research lab (where everyone 
               else is) from the observation room
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "Okay. I can't say for sure, but her 
                         white cell count is down significantly. 
                         White blood cells are a major part of

               Time passes. Woods is nodding off as he sits next to Aiyana, 
               who is still sleeping on the cot in the barracks. Suddenly, she 
               wakes and sits up.

                         have to admit I feel a little guilty,

                         figure out how..."
 
               Aiyana caresses Woods face and he loses consciousness. Aiyana 
               leaves the barracks.

                         a disease control team in here."
 
               
                                     OSBOURNE
                         "I'm gonna relieve Woods."

               
                                     MICHAELS
                         "Okay."

               
               Osbourne leaves. He walks by Teal'c who is sitting in a chair, 
               surrounded by lit candles in Kel-No-Reem. He continues on to 
               find Woods passed out on the cot and Aiyana gone.
 
               
                                     OSBOURNE
                         "Norm, wake up...Norm..."

               Osbourne leaves. We next see Osbourne entering Sam and Janet's 
               barracks and turning on the lights just as Sam and Janet are 
               standing up.
 
               
                                     OSBOURNE
                         "She's missing. Woods is unconscious." 
                         Janet and Sam follow Woods out into 
                         another area of the base. Osbourne points 
                         to a door. "Check there."
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "Yeah."

               
               She and Sam enter the room as Osbourne checks on another room 
               across the way. Osbourne is soon behind them as the enter the 
               room to find Jonas bending over an unconscious Aiyana who is 
               laying on the floor. Jack is laying on a cot a few feet away. 
               Sam and Osbourne join Jonas as Janet checks on Jack.
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "It's okay. It's okay." (to the others): 
                         "He's burning up."
 
               
               
               

               
               
               ANTARCTIC BASE ENTRANCE. A DISEASE CONTROL TEAM IS ENTERING CARRYING 
               EQUIPMENT AND WEARING BIOHAZARD SUITS. SCENE CHANGE TO O’NEILL 
               WHO IS NOW LAYING IN AN AIR FORCE RESCUE CONTAINMENT STRETCHER. 
               JANET IS WEARING A BIOHAZARD SUIT AND IS CLOSING THE "LID" ON 
               THE CONTAINMENT STRETCHER (THERE IS PROBABLY A BETTER TERM FOR 
               THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, BUT I DON'T KNOW IT. ;-) ).
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "You're going to be fine, sir. I'll 
                         see you soon."
 
               
               We see Jonas giving similar assurance to Aiyana who is in an 
               identical stretcher next to O'Neill. Everyone is wearing a biohazard 
               suit except Teal'c, who is holding his suit.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "Teal'c, even though you don't have 
                         the disease, you could still carry the 
                         virus. We'll all get properly cleared 
                         once we get back to the SGC."
 
               
               Teal'c nods his head and Sam continues on her way.

                         SGC - Sam is in the observation bay 
                         above the room where Janet is working 
                         on O'Neill. General Hammond approaches 
                         Sam.
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "Blood pressure's holding 80 over 40. 
                         I wanna do a manual and uh, get me the 
                         results of his latest bloodwork."

                                     SAM
                         "They're doing everything they can,

                         "We talked to the Tok'ra, They said 
                         this might be beyond their help, but 
                         they're sending someone anyway."
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "His best chance is Aiyana, sir. She 
                         managed to halt the virus completely 
                         in the rest of us."
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         " Why hasn't she been able to stop it 
                         in herself?"

                         "From what I've been able to learn so 
                         far, sir, the virus ultimately acts 
                         like cerebrospinal meningitis by attacking 
                         the brain. Despite the physical similarities, 
                         Aiyana's brain chemistry seems to be 
                         quite different from ours. I suppose 
                         it's possible she's able to trigger 
                         an immune response in us that she can't 
                         muster in herself once the disease reaches 
                         an end stage."

                         "What are the odds she'll survive?"
 
                         
               
               Janet shakes her head slightly in a negative way. Sam looks down 
               at the floor and then up at General Hammond. All three turn to 
               look at O'Neill who is resting comfortably on a gurney with a 
               nasal cannula in his nose.
 
               
                                     SCENE CHANGE
                         Another room in the SGC infirmary. Aiyana 
                         lays on a similar cot with a similar 
                         nasal cannula in her nose. Jonas approaches 
                         her wearing a biohazard suit. As he 
                         approaches, she opens her eyes.
 
               
                                     JONAS
                         "Hey...glad to see you're awake. I had 
                         a feeling that you were gonna make it. 
                         Thanks for what you did for me. You 
                         didn't have to do that...not for any 
                         of us." (Aiyana appears to be in pain 
                         for a minute.) "Hey, take it easy, huh? 
                         You've gotta get your strength back. 
                         Colonel O'Neill still needs your help. 
                         More than that...we want you to live. 
                         I want you to live."
 
               
               Aiyana shakes her head weakly...no.

                                     AIYANA
                         "Sor-ry."

               
                                     JONAS
                         "Aiyana!"

               Jonas is pushed back out of the way as several medical personnel 
               (all dressed in biohazard suits) begin working on Aiyana as alarms 
               go off on her monitors. Dr. Fraiser walks in.
 
               
                                     JONAS
                         "She just, uh..."

               
                                     JANET
                         "Bag her. Give me one milligram epi...charging 
                         to 200...clear...nothing...charging 
                         to 300...clear...come on, come on...again...clear."
 
                         
               The camera focuses is no Jonas who watches helplessly as Aiyana 
               succumbs to the virus.

                         The SGC briefing room. General Hammond, 
                         the Tok'ra: Thorna, Sam and Teal'c enter 
                         the room through the stairs.
 
               
                                     THORAN
                         "His condition is beyond the healing 
                         of a hand device. However, there is 
                         a symbiote who is in dire need of a

                                     SAM

                         "Well, the former host was mortally 
                         wounded on assignment and the symbiote 
                         was unable to heal him. We believe that 
                         would not be the case with Colonel O'Neill. 
                         Physical trauma is much more difficult 
                         to deal with than disease."
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         "I do not believe Colonel O'Neill would 
                         chose to become a Tok'ra." (He looks 
                         at Sam who nods her agreement.)
 
               
                                     THORAN
                         "I am aware of the Colonel's dislike 
                         for our kind, however, I am surprised 
                         that you think he would choose death 
                         over blending."
 
               
               Jonas walks up the stairs into the room.

                         "Aiyana's dead." (Sam closes her eyes 
                         briefly). "Dr. Fraiser did everything 
                         she could, but..."
 
               
                                     SAM
                         "She may have been on borrowed time 
                         from the start." (Jonas nods his head 
                         in understanding.)

                         is Jonas Quinn. The Tok'ra are offering

                         is we may be in the position of having 
                         to decide for him."

                         blend with an unwilling host permanently.

                         well. I have no doubt that he would 
                         be willing to blend with O'Neill, cure 
                         him, and then leave him again if another 
                         suitable host can be found."

                         "I assure you he would ultimately sacrifice 
                         himself rather than remain with an unwilling 
                         host. Kanan's former host died before 
                         he was able to reveal the details of 
                         what we believe was vital intelligence 
                         about the undercover mission he was 
                         on. I cannot stress enough how important

                         the opportunity to decide for himself."
 
                         
               
                                     SCENE CHANGE
                         The room where O'Neill is being cared 
                         for. Sam enters (wearing a biohazard 
                         suit) and approaches the gurney. Janet 
                         is already there.
 
               
                                     JANET
                         "I'm administering point one epi. I 
                         don't know if this is gonna work."
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         " Will it hurt him?"

               
                                     JANET
                         "Can't get much worse."

               
               Janet backs away and Sam leans in closer.

               
                                     SAM
                         "Sir, I don't know if you can hear me...the 
                         Tok'ra have offered you a deal. There's 
                         a symbiote that needs a host. They think 
                         it could cure you. Now, it may be your 
                         only chance. It would only be temporary. 
                         It would come out of you as soon as 
                         they found another host. Sir...are you 
                         getting any of this?"
 
               
               Sam backs away and looks at Janet, looking rather disappointed. 
               We see Jonas and Hammond in the observation room, looking concerned.
 
               
               
                                     JACK
                         "Carter?"

               
                                     SAM
                         "Yeah, I'm right here."

               
                                     JACK
                         "Over my dead body."

               
               Sam closes her eyes and nods her head.

               
                                     SAM
                         "Sir, the symbiote's host died while 
                         they were on a mission. The Tok'ra have 
                         strong reason to believe that the symbiote 
                         has vital information to reveal and 
                         this would give him that chance. Now, 
                         they promised that if no other host 
                         was found within a reasonable amount 
                         of time, the symbiote would sacrifice 
                         itself rather than stay in an unwilling 
                         host. Sir...please..."
 
               
               Jack finally nods his head, ever so slightly, in the affirmative. 
               Sam smiles and turns to look at Janet who smiles back. They both 
               turn to smile up at the observation room.
 
               
                                     SCENE CHANGE
                         SGC 'gate room. - O'Neill is back in 
                         the rescue pod. He is being carried 
                         by Sam, Thoran, Teal'c, Jonas, and two 
                         medics. They carry him through the Stargate.
 
                         
               
               THE END
